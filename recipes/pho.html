        <h1>Pho soup</h1>
        <img src="../pho.jpg">
        <h2>This easy Vietnamese inspired Pho Soup includes rice noodles in a flavorful broth with your choice of meat, and topped with fresh herbs and vegetables. It’s my quick and easy adaptation that’s not authentic, but tastes amazing!</h2>
        <h3><strong>Ingradients</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Broth</strong></h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Chicken/beef broth: I recommend chicken broth if making chicken, shrimp or pork pho. Use beef broth for beef pho or vegetable broth for vegetarian pho.</li>
            <li>Yellow onion and fresh ginger</li>
            <li>Spices: ground coriander, cloves, fish  sauce, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, red chili paste, cinnamon, salt and pepper.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><strong>Noodles</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li> I use an 8 oz. package of dried rice vermicelli noodles, but you can use any kind of THIN rice noodles.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><strong>Meat</strong></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>chicken, pork, steak or raw shrimp.  It’s important to slice the meat as thinly as possible, against the grain. Meat is much easier to slice when it’s slightly frozen so don’t be afraid to stick it in the freezer for an hour before slicing.</li>
            <li>Beef pho (phở bò): ½ lb. sirloin steak, flank steak, brisket, or round eye, seasoned with salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>
            <h4><strong>Garnishes</strong></h4>

            <ul>

            <li>Green onions</li>
            <li>Fresh jalapeño peppers or red Thai chili peppers</li>
            <li>Fresh herbs (cilantro, basil leaves, mint leaves)</li>
            <li>Fresh bean sprouts</li>
            <li>Lime wedges</li>
            <li>Sriracha hot sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>

        
        
        <ol>
            <li>Place a large dry pot over medium heat add the onion halves and ginger pieces and cook for 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the broth, water, coriander, clove, fish sauce, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, chili garlic paste, cinnamon stick and a pinch of fresh cracked salt and pepper to the pot. Bring to a slow boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes or more.</li>
            <li>Prepare the noodles: prepare rice noodles according to package instructions. Once soft, drain, rinse and set aside.</li>
            <li>Prepare the garnishes: Ready the garnishes in individual small bowls for serving: cilantro, basil, green onions, bean sprouts, lime wedges and sliced chilies.</li>
            <li>Add meat to broth:

                1-5 minutes before the broth is done cooking, add desired meat to the broth to cook, just until done (2-3 minutes for raw, thinly sliced chicken or pork, 1-2 minutes for shrimp or thinly sliced steak).
                Discard the ginger, clove, cinnamon stick and onion pieces from the pot.</li>
            <li>Assemble: Add cooked rice noodles to individual bowls and ladle hot broth over the top. Pile high with your favorite garnishes.</li>
        </ol>
